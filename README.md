<span>Hello, my dear!</span>

<h2>ABOUT ME!</h2>
<p>My name you know, but my history no! I birth and live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Since I was a child, I play with computers and eletronics, is my favorite thing. So when I got 14 years old, I decided learn development. I'd start with Python, but I did wanna see my results, then start study JavaScript.</p>
<br>
<p>Today I know JavaScript and Python, but my focus is JavaScript and your variables.</p>
<br>
<p>My objective is be a great developer. I like have a good fundament to make my rocket launch to the space called internet.</p>
